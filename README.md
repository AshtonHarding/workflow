# WorkFlow-Tool

This tool's purpose is to help track projects and
their progress.

+ custom user levels (Manager, Level 1, etc.)
+ Users can only see what the Admins set it at:
For example:
Manager_A can only see A_projects.
Worker_A_0 can only see A_projects that are at level 0.
Worker_A_1 can only see A_projects that are at level 1.
Manager_B can only see B_projects
etc.

Worker_A_0 can mark off A_0 project as done. (marking it
as "A_1" instead.) and etc.

### How I want to make this
I want to build it in C. Although, perhaps making it in
another language woud be better. For example, Javascript
makes it easier to run in browser, which is probably
where you would want to run it. Perhaps I can do a C-backend
and a Javascript-frontend.
I want to use the minimal amount of libraries as possible,
as js does get quite a bit bulky.

### When will it be done
When will anything really be "done" :P
